      axis in a coordinate space identical to those of motion events,
      representing a relative movement along the specified axis.

      For devices that support movements non-parallel to axes multiple
      axis events will be emitted.

      When applicable, for example for touch pads, the server can
      choose to emit scroll events where the motion vector is
      equivalent to a motion event vector.

      When applicable, a client can transform its content relative to the
      scroll distance.
